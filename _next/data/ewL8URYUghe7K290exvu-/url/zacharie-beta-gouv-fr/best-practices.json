Otherwise, the application becomes vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks where an attacker can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive by issuing a large number of requests at the same

res.sendFile(path);\n});\n\n```\nTo prevent denial-of-service attacks, the `express-rate-limit` package can be used:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\n// set up rate limiter: maximum of five requests per minute\nvar RateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');\nvar limiter = RateLimit({\n  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes\n  max: 100, // max 100
